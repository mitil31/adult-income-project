## 🧪 Project Steps

1. **Load the data**
2. **Clean and preprocess** the dataset
3. **Encode categorical features**
4. Train multiple models:
   - Logistic Regression
   - K-Nearest Neighbors
   - Support Vector Machine
   - Random Forest
   - XGBoost
5. **Evaluate models** using:
   - Accuracy
   - F1 Score
6. **Visualize results** for comparison
